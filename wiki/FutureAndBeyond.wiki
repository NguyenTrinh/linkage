#summary Ideas and planning for the rewrite

= Introduction =
Use this page to put up ideas for changes in the code base for the rewrite, and whatever new problems that arises with a Client-Server model and how to solve those etc.

= Server / Client =
_list interfaces that we need to export through xmlrpc_

= Library =
=== Merge SessionManager and TorrentManager ===
These two are currently too intertwined, a merge makes sense in this regard.

  * Remove all complex cruft, keeping it simple is the key.
  * Move self contained stuff to stand alone classes which would be easier to extend in time, like a TorrentQueue, EventQueue.

=== The Torrent class ===
This class contains most of the "weak" code, because we're wrapping so much of the functionallity of libtorrent's torrent_handle in helper.

Therefore we should really remove alot of the current helpers, just keep whats really needed and makes sense. Advanced functionallity should be done through the torrent_handle.

=== Plugins ===
Should plugins live at the Server side at all?
Keeping them only on Client side would mean we would have to export a whole lot of functionallity through xmlrpc, and Server - Client traffic would increase.

A plugin living on the Server side would probably have to register some functionallity to the core so that it can be called/notified from the Client side.
