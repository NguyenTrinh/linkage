#Installation instructions

= Fedora Core 7 =

Packages are available for both linkage and rb_libtorrent, all you have to do is run the following as root.
{{{
yum -y install boost gtkmm24 libnotify curl dbus-glib libupnp
rpm -ivh http://linkage.googlecode.com/files/rb_libtorrent-0.12-1.fc7.i386.rpm
rpm -ivh http://linkage.googlecode.com/files/linkage-0.1.2-1.fc7.i386.rpm
}}}

= Ubuntu Feisty 7.04 =

Currently there are no packages for rb_libtorrent nor linkage for Ubuntu. So if you want to install linkage you have to build them both from source. Libtorrent can be downloaded [http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=79942&filename=libtorrent-0.12.tar.gz here], linkage source code is available from the [http://code.google.com/p/linkage/downloads/list download page] or from [http://code.google.com/p/linkage/source SVN].
