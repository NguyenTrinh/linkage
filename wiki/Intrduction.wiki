#summary General information about Linkage and some screenshots

= Introduction =

Linkage is a BitTorrent client written in C++. It based on libtorrent and uses the GTK+ toolkit (through gtkmm).

= Purpose =

At the time I started writing Linkage there wasn't any decent BitTorrent client around for the GTK+ desktop. I guess Dave had a similar view of things when he started his own client, I saw it and suggested that we merged our efforts. The result is Linkage.

= Screenshots =
