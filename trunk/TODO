* Revamp plugins
* Mathusalem plugin? http://tw.apinc.org/weblog/2006/08/13#mathusalem-gets-useful
* Update TorrentCreator (private flag, DHT, multi tracker)
* Make plugins configureable
* Add RSS, Scheduler and Auto-file filter (like *.nfo etc...) plugins
* Make it possible to add user-defined trackers
* Add sort on time remaining
* Fix colors in CellrendererPiecemap (looks like the brighter colors aren't alloc'ed)
* Save .resume on tracker_announce_alert, that way we are on par with tracker (uploaded/downloaded) even if we crash ?
* on_torrent_finished, if files are filtered and then unfiltered we should do set_complete(false)
